# Automated test for L6

## Run the tests

### Preparing the API service
First we have to clone the API service repo to our local system.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:pupilfirst/wd301-api.git
```

Then inside the project folder, we have to install all npm modules
```sh
npm install
```

Once that is done, next will create our database and then we will migrate our tables
```sh
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

Next, we've to create a `.env` file in project folder to define the port number there
```sh
echo PORT=3001 > .env
```

Now we are all set to start our server
```sh
npm run srart
```

### Preparing the React app
First we have to clone the React app from student's repo and then install the npm modules
```sh
npm install
```

Next, we have to create a `.env` file in project folder to define the API service URL
```sh
echo REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:3001" > .env
```

Next, we will run the Cypress test suite
```sh
npm run cy:run -- --env STUDENT_SUBMISSION_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
```
